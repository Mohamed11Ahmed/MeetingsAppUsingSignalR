I  have developed a demo application to practice my skills. The demo is a simple meeting rooms platform that features real-time whiteboard and group chat functionalities.

Using SignalR, I was able to manage real-time connections and online users across different meeting rooms. This ensured that all members could see changes made to the whiteboard and group chat in real-time. To further enhance the experience, I stored both the chat and whiteboard data on a SQL Server database, allowing members who joined the room later to see the latest updates.

I used a range of tools for developing the application, including ASP.NET MVC for building the web application, canvas for the whiteboard, and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery for the front-end. I also utilized MS SQL for the database.
